# Installing and Running Postr  

First, clone this repository by opening your terminal and pasting in the following line :  
`$ git clone https://github.com/dbgrigsby/Postr.git`  

Next, download python 3.6 by following this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/. Make sure that python3 is aliased to the python libraries. This will be an option when running the python installer.


Once you have cloned the repository and downloaded python 3.6, run these 3 lines :

1. `$ cd Postr`  

2. `$ make install`

3. `$ make gui`  

After you run these commands, the Postr application will start, and it will open a window that has empty text boxes corresponding to different social media websites. If you do not see these text boxes, click the 'Profile' tab in the navigation bar. Fill in your social media credentials, and explore the many features of Postr!
