  Created basic kivy app
  - Set up base application
  - Added tabs for each future feature
  - Runs locally using Cython 0.28.5 and Kivy 1.9.1
  
  Researched how to dockerize kivy app
  - Modified Dockerfile to included Cython, one of the dependencies required for Kivy
  - Have tried using Cython versions 0.20 through 0.28.5
  - Have tried using Kivy versions 1.09 through 1.10 
  - After reading countless articals and sifting through a lot of code I am currently unalbe to dockerize our kivy application, however there are a few other things to continue trying next week to make the application work
